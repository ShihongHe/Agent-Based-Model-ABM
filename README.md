# Agent Based Model (ABM)
## 1.Project Overview
This project is an Agent-Based Model (ABM) learning project with nine ABM model files, ranging from simple to complex, to explore the evolution and behaviour of the overall system by modelling the interactions and influences between agents.In this project, we will practice using ABM to model and simulate specific systems, while also building skills in testing, debugging, defining functions and classes, reading and writing data, organizing code into modules, developing a simple graphical user interface, and scraping and processing data from the web.
By completing this project, you will have gained some practical programming skills and experience in agent model building that will help you to better apply Python in other areas and projects.
