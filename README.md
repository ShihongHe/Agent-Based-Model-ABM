# Agent Based Model (ABM)
## 1.Project Overview
This project is an Agent-Based Model (ABM) learning project with nine ABM model files, ranging from simple to complex, to explore the evolution and behaviour of the overall system by modelling the interactions and influences between agents.In this project, we will practice using ABM to model and simulate specific systems, while also building skills in testing, debugging, defining functions and classes, reading and writing data, organizing code into modules, developing a simple graphical user interface, and scraping and processing data from the web.
By completing this project, you will have gained some practical programming skills and experience in agent model building that will help you to better apply Python in other areas and projects.
## 2.Installing dependencies
Before you can run the code for this project, you will need to install the following Python dependency libraries:
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- requests
- tkinter
## 3.Project structure and description of documents
- `src/:`Store the source code files containing the 9 ABM models.
  - `abm1`:Initial understanding of the abm model and implementation of distance calculations.
  
  - `abm2`:Drawing with Matplotlib and mastering loops.
  
  - `abm3`:Define functions and understand the time complexity of the code written, illustrated graphically. Know how to write code to calculate statistical data on distances.
  
  - `abm4`:Definition Classes.
  
  - `abm5`:Read and write data and get to grips with the interaction of agents and the environment.
  
  - `abm6`:Wrapping functionally identical methods into modules.
  
  - `abm7`:Knowledge of handling exception statements.
  
  - `abm8`:Operationalisation of the AMB model using Graphical User Interface(GUI).
  
  - `abm9`:Crawling data from the web.
  
`data/:`Store the data files used to test and run the model.
